# Odan-Urr | The App-Quality CSS library

Welcome to the official App-Quality CSS library.

Odan-Urr is an ancient sass library, erected and developed by old Master Jedi and based on The Force (of [atomic design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)).

## Getting started

If you are a developer and you need to build complex pages with App Quality components, this is the right place for you.

#### **First step**
Import the library in your project with your preferred method (e.g. `<link>`), find the css master file in the **[/dist](https://github.com/raziel8/odan-urr/tree/master/dist/css)** folder.

#### **Second step**
That's it! You're ready to use the library and made your design consistent through different devices and tools.

## Components

> This library is javascript-agnostic. Use your fantasy/belief (aka. vanilla js, jquery, any javascript framework) to *animate* them.

#### Colors

Find all the color references in `_colors.scss`.
